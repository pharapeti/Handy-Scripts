# About this script

This organises the files in a folder called Daily which exists on my Desktop. The script loops through each file in the folder and sorts them
by last modified date.

# Why do this?

- It makes it easier for me track work I have completed
- Formalises a file structure
- Makes it easier to find files after I have uploaded them to the Cloud (usually Google Drive)

# Is this open source?

Of course!
